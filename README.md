# *Thoth*
This is a knowledge base for the Computer Science course. It is supposed to be a summarized view of all the technical terms and fancy jargon used in computer science.
The idea is to introduce the technical terms, provide brief explanations about them and, optionally, include explanatory examples to demonstrate those terms in action!

## Why *Thoth*?
Thoth was the Egyptian God that was commonly associated with writing and scribes. To me, writing is aThoth great way to preserve and share knowledge. This database is currently maintained by me, but I will happily receive any contributions. The database is mainly related to Computer Science.

## Recomendations
As some markdown files are related to each other, I would recommend using a tool called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (not sponsored in any way), as it has a very useful graph visualization feature that allows you to have an overview over any related terms. This could help you grasp the current knwoledge base and identify possible ways in which you can contribute. Also, graphs are nice :).

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to this repository. The more knowledge we can gather, the better! Feel free to send in pull requests including any jargon you feel is missing from our knowledge base.

There are, however, some rules that we have established to make working with others a little nicer. These are the following:
* Whenever you introduce a new note, please ensure that it has the appropriate relations
	* Each new topic should have its sepparate folder when appropriate. This may depend on the context of what you are writing/researching about.
	* Each folder must define its own note, describing its contents. (A description is not mandatory)
	* The files within the folder must be related to this *head* note.
* Use kebab-case for everything. This includes folder, note and tag names.
* Always include citations for the information you write. This is important not only to allow readers to have access to a more in-depth explanation of content, but also to give credit to the author(s) you are citing from.
* Lastly, please verify the existing notes, to see if you content can be associated to any of the topics. This also avoids any duplicate notes and ensures that we can easily maintain the whole database.

If you feel something requires restructuring, you can talk to me on GitHub. It's never too late to turn things around.
