# The Computer Science Knowledge Base
This is a knowledge base for the Computer Science course. It is supposed to be a summarized view of all the technical terms and fancy jargon used in computer science.
The idea is to introduce the technical terms, provide brief explanations about them and, optionally, include explanatory examples to demonstrate those terms in action!
