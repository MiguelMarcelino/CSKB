# *Thoth*
This is a knowledge base for the Computer Science course. It is supposed to be a summarized view of all the technical terms and fancy jargon used in computer science.
The idea is to introduce the technical terms, provide brief explanations about them and, optionally, include explanatory examples to demonstrate those terms in action!

## Why *Thoth*?
Thoth was the Egyptian God that was commonly associated with writing and scribes. To me, writing is a great way to preserve and share knowledge. This database is currently maintained by me, but I am open to any contributions. The topics in the database are mainly related to Computer Science.

## Recomendations
I would recommend using a tool called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (not sponsored in any way), as it has a very useful graph visualization feature that allows you to have an overview over any related terms. The idea is to build a digital mind-map of all the knowledge you can gather, with the intent of finding notes much more efficiently. I also makes identifying possible contributions much faster.

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to this repository. The more notes are created, the better! Feel free to send in pull requests including any topics you feel are missing from the current knowledge base.

There are, however, some rules I have established to make working with others a little nicer. These are the following:
* Whenever you introduce a new note, please ensure that it has the appropriate relations
	* Each new topic should have its sepparate folder when appropriate. This may depend on the context of what you are writing/researching about.
	* Each folder must define its own note, describing its contents. (A description is not mandatory, but helpful)
	* The files within the folder must be related to this *head* note.
* Use kebab-case for everything. This includes folder, note and tag names.
* Always include citations for the information you write. This is important not only to allow readers to have access to a more in-depth explanation of content, but also to give credit to the author(s) you are citing from.

If you feel something requires restructuring, you can `@` me on GitHub. It's never too late to turn things around.
