# The Computer Science Knowledge Base
This is a knowledge base for the Computer Science course. It is supposed to be a summarized view of all the technical terms and fancy jargon used in computer science.
The idea is to introduce the technical terms, provide brief explanations about them and, optionally, include explanatory examples to demonstrate those terms in action!

## Recomendations
As some markdown files are related to ech other, I would recommend using a tool called obsidian (not sponsored in any way), as it has a very useful graph visualization feature that allows you to have an overview over any related terms. This could also help you find what you are looking for in the knwoledge base.

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to this repository. The more knowledge we can gather, the better! Feel free to send in pull requests including any jargon you feel is missing from our knowledge base. 
We only ask that you sepparate the various topics into different markdown files. If you feel it is necessary, please create a new markdown file that starts a new topic and add your content there. Before creating a new file, we ask you to please verify the existing markdown files, to see if you content can be associated to any of the topics. 

Furthermore, whenever you want to add any content, please supply the necessary sources to allow the reader to read more in-depth explanations of the definitions available in the knowledge base. This is also important for copyright. Always cite the authors you are gathering your information from.

Lastly, we suggest you follow the current naming scheme and use hiphens instead of spaces.
