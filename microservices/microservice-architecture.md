# Microservice Architecture
Architecture that structures the application as a set of loosely coupled, collaborating services. This approach corresponds to the Y-axis of theÂ [scale-cube](scale-cube.md). Each service is:
* Highly maintainable and testable
	* Rapid and frequent development and deployment
* Loosely coupled with other services
	* Teams work independently
	* Teams are not impacted by changes to other services and don't affect other services
* Independently deployable
	* Deploy their service without having to coordinate with other teams
* Capable of being developed by a small team
	* high productivity 
	* Avoids high cocmmunication head of large teams
