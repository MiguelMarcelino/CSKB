# Domain Driven Design
* Approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain (definition from Eric Evans).
* Idea: software systems need to be based on a well-developed model of a domain
* The core idea is the need for a [Ubiquitous Language](ubiquitous-language)Â that embeds domain terminology into the software systems that we build.
* Objects should be classified as: Entities, Value Objects, and Service Objects

## Patterns
* [Aggregate](aggregate.md)
* [Domain Event](domain-event.md)
