* Scala comes from the word *scalable*
* Combines Object-Oriented (OO) and Functional programming
* Runs on the JVM
* Statically Typed
	* Included Type inference mechanism, which reduces the amount of types necessary at compile-time
* Optimized for parallel operations
	* Partially inspired on Erlang (Built for scalable software)
