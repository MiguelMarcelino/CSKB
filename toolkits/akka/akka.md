# Akka
Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent systems that are scalable, highly efficient, and resilient by using [Reactive Principles](reactive-principles). Akka uses the the [actor model](actor-model) to provide a level of abstraction.

**Akka provides:**
- Multi-threaded behavior without the use of low-level concurrency constructs like atomics or locks.
- Transparent remote communication between systems and their components.
- Clustered, high-availability, elastic architecture, that scales on demand.
