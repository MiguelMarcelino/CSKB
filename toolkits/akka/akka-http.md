* Akka HTTP modules implement a full server- and client-side HTTP stack on top of _akka-actor_ and _akka-stream_. 
* It’s not a web-framework but rather a more general toolkit for providing and consuming HTTP-based services. While interaction with a browser is of course also in scope it is not the primary focus of Akka HTTP.
