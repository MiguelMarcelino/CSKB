# Kalix
* Kalix is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that combines an **API-first**, **database-less programming model** with a **serverless runtime**.
* Kalix brings advanced data access patterns like [Event Sourcing](event-sourcing), [CQRS](cqrs), and [CRDTs](conflixt-free-replicated-data-type) without developers having to learn how to implement them.

## Database-less
* Traditional serverless platforms:
	* Separate the data from the service.
	* Explicitly connect platforms to read existing records, create new records, or update values.
* Kalix
	* in-memory state reduces latency for data-centric operations.

## API-first
* Kalix lets developers create data objects by creating an abstraction over the database
